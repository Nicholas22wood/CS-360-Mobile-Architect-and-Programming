Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The application I developed is a weight tracking application that tracks the userâ€™s weight over a period of time. The application includes a login as well as a tracking system and it stores this information to the SQLite database provided by Android. The basic needs for the user was a login screen as well as a tracking system that would allow the user to create, update, delete, and view the information.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

For my application I have created four screens, the first screen is the login screen, the second screen is a new user screen, the third screen is a pop up screen asking the user if they would allow the application to send notification and the fourth screen is the main page where all the weights and dates get manipulated. I focused most of my design on what the users needed, which was a login screen and a screen where they can manipulate the weights and dates. I believe I was successful in the login portion as well as the main page portion, but I think I could have put more time into the main page making it more user friendly.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The process I took was first figuring out what the user required and then developing around that. I also wanted to spend the most time on portions of the project that were going to be the most used. I did not want to spend too much time on the new user or notification page as the user will spend most of their time on the main page. This will help me in the future when deciding priority, having the user in mind makes the most sense and changing the priorities should always be with the users in mind.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The process I went through with testing was to break the code into sections and test each section by itself and then bring everything together and test it again. This was very helpful as I was able to make sure I got the right solution for each portion and making sure the navigation was correct, if I were to test everything at once it would be more difficult to find the problem and wouldn't be as efficient. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One section that I changed up a lot from the design and development phase was the buttons on the main page. I had an idea of adding the weight and date and having it display below or just in that area and you would click a button to delete it but that was not practical and it was not as smooth of a process. I changed it so the dates and weights were put into a different SQLite database and running a command would output all the dates and weights for the user and if they need to change or delete anything they would just need to know the date and could delete that entry.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Even though it is just the beginning of the application I feel the login screen and inputs were designed really well and how the navigation from the page to page worked really smoothly as well. I think that showed how much I learned in the coding portion as the login screen seemed simplistic but do make it function properly took a lot of time.
